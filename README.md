If You want to check out this pawsome web, please download the files and open with code. In Your terminal, type:

$npm install

$npm start

$npm run json:server

P.S. Json server has been causing problems with POST requests (while all the other ones work perfectly fine) so sometimes the webpage doesn't work properly. If that happens, I apologize, check it out later or in a few days (I usually had to wait a few days for it to start working again).

P.P.S. The database for all the pets awailable has not yet been completed, however, in section "Bebe azila" it is complete, and also in section "Udomi me, Å¾ivim u azilu" it is complete for the first 10 dogos. The database will at some point be complete. Until then, Your are still able to check how it works if You select one of the first 10 dogos to add to Your home cart.
